# Bank-Customer-Churn-Modelling
Bank Customer Churn Modelling using PyTorch

Customers have an important role in determining the success of any business and lack of customers lead
to the downfall of any business. Every firm focuses on attracting more customers and retaining the
existing ones. Losing customers to their competitors leads to the loss in a huge market share and thus it is
of utmost importance to understand the fact that the key to success for any firm is its customer base.
Nowadays firms focus on a consumer centric approach of business. Customer satisfaction is a very
important factor in the modern day business models. In the modern day, the customer expectations are
high and keeps changing, the business models have to cope up with this change. Lack of adaptability to
new trends in the market will result in the failure of traditional businesses.
Churn or Customer churn or Customer attrition is simply the number of customers discontinuing the
existing relationship with a business. It is easier and less expensive to retain an existing customer than to
find new customers and hence churn is considered as a critical metric in the modern day business. The
churn rate also shows the quality of service provided to the customer, ie if the churn rate is high, it means
that more number of customers are not satisfied with the services. Depending on the churn rate, the
business can also take measures to improve their services and come up with strategies so as to retain the
customers.
Predicting the churn will help the business to identify the customers that are about to leave and the
business can come up with strategies specifically focussed on that particular customers and thereby retain
them. In this project, the business is a bank and the customer churn is predicted using few of the customer
attributes. Prediction is done using classification technique (since the target variable has only two
outcomes) and PyTorch package is used.
